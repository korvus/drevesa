    "goalContent": "This not-quite-essential app catalogues the trees — and sometimes the tree-lined avenues — that the residents of Ljubljana elect each year since 2019. [br][br]Ljubljana has been recognised as a 'Tree City' within the [a href='https://treecitiesoftheworld.org/']'Tree Cities of the World'[/a] programme for several consecutive years, proof of the city's ongoing care for its trees. [br][br]Each edition is carried by citizens: they put forward the candidates, vote online, and choose either a single tree or—when it feels right—an entire avenue. [br][br]The aim is to highlight this living heritage, share the stories behind these trees, and encourage everyone to observe them, understand them, and help preserve them.",
