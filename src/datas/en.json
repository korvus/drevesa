[br][br]Ljubljana has been recognized as a \"Tree City\" within the [a href='https://treecitiesoftheworld.org/']\"Tree Cities of the World\"[/a] program for two consecutive years. This price encourages cities to take care of their trees.[br][br]It is therefore not surprising that the Ljubljana citizens choose and elect the \"Tree of the Year\" every year since 2019. The choice of candidate trees is entirely decided by the citizens.[br][br]Many trees grow in Ljubljana, with their unique stories and special place they hold in the minds of the residents. The main purpose of the initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of trees for the city. Encourage the observation of trees and their understanding improve the quality of life in a city.",
